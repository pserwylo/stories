# Story

Mana beach was a small beach.
There was only a little bit of sand, and it quickly turned into forest.
Nobody really visited Mana beach, except for the wave.

Every day, for thousands of years, the same wave crawled up the sand.
Each time it rolled up, it would bring a little extra sand with it from the depths of the ocean, and drop it on the beach front.

You could be mistaken for thinking Mana beach was a normal beach.
You could be mistaken for thinking the wave was a normal wave.
Neither of them were normal.
The wave had an important job to do.
Each time it brought sand from the ocean, it dropped it on a secret trapdoor in the middle of the beach.
It was the waves job to make sure the trapdoor stayed covered, so that nothing from the other side could come through.

It was a tough job, because twice a day, an unstoppable force would suck the wave back into the depths of the ocean, leaving the sand exposed for half the day.
So the wave only had half a day to bring as much sand as possible, before it was pulled back into the ocean, leaving the beach exposed.
For the other half of the day, the wind came, trying its best to return the sand back to the ocean.
It didn't mean to.
It didn't dislike the wave, or understand the important work the wave was doing to protect the trapdoor.
It just loved blowing around, moving things, and seeing what was underneath.

Lately, the wave was getting tired.
As it rolled up for the first time in the morning, it huffed and it puffed, trying so hard to bring more sand to the beach.
But it was becoming more difficult.
There was less sand in the ocean, and the wave was not as strong as it used to be.

Yesterday, something unfortunate happened.
The wave was pulled back from the beach at the end of the day, and sighed.
It was a good days work, but not the same as the wave could manage several hundred years ago when it was stroner and there was more sand in the ocean.
When night fell, the wind got to work.
It blew and blew, and the sand slowly moved away from the top of the trap door, until a tiny corner emerged.

Wave comes back.

COvers trapdoor.

Then same thing happens again.
