The beach was a small beach.
Nobody really visited the beach, except for the wave, and the wind.

Every day, for thousands of years, the wave crawled up the sand.
And every time it came, it would bring a little extra sand with it from the depths of the ocean, to drop on the beach.

You see, the wave had an important job to do.
In the middle of the beach, completely covered in sand, there was a trapdoor.
It was the waves job to make sure the trapdoor stayed covered, so that nothing from the other side would ever come through.

It was a tough job, because twice a day, the wave would be dragged back into the ocean, leaving the beach and the trapdoor alone.
Alone, that is, except for the wind.
While the wave was gone, the wind would roar, trying its best to return the sand back to the ocean.
With each breath, the trapdoor was closer to being revealed, until the wave returned again with more sand to cover it back up.

Lately, the wave was getting tired.
As it rolled up for the first time in the morning, it huffed and it puffed, trying to bring more sand to the beach.
It was becoming more difficult.
There seemed to be less sand in the ocean, and the wave was not as strong as it used to be.

When the end of the day came, the wave sighed as it was pulled back from into the ocean.
It was tired.
Although it was a good days work, there just wasn't enough sand in the ocean for the wave to put on top of the trapdoor.
When night fell, the wind got to work.
It blew and blew, and the sand slowly moved away from the top of the trapdoor, until a tiny wooden corner appeared.

When the wave came back in the morning, there was a strange light shining through the corner of the trapdoor, and a quiet "thump, thump" could be heard on the other side.
The wave didn't know what was on the other side, but today was not the day it was going to find out.

The wave immediately got to work, gathering sand from the the ocean and dumping it on the corner of the trapdoor.
By the time the day was complete, the entire trapdoor was covered with sand again.
Although the wave was exhausted, it was sure the beach would be safe from whatever was on the other side of the trapdoor for one more night.
How wrong it was.

That night the wind was stronger than it had ever been before.
It is almost as if it was excited about revealing the trapdoor again.
After several hours of huffing and puffing, a corner of the door appeared again.
The light shone through the cracks.
The "thump, thump" came back, but this time louder and stronger.
By the time the morning arrived, more than half the trapdoor was showing and the light was almost as bright as the morning sun.

The tired wave rolled up, but it couldn't even bring enough sand.
Each time it brought sand, the "THUMP, THUMP" from the trapdoor shook it off, and more of the trapdoor was revealed.
The wave had lost.
There was no more sand left in the ocean, and so the wave rolled sadly away from the beach as the "THUMP, THUMP" from the trapdoor grew louder and stronger.

With one final "THUMP", the door burst open.
A light flashed across the water, so bright that the wave was pushed even further away.
The wave was not sure if it could ever return to the beach.

The wave did not return the next day, or the next.
It took two weeks before the wave was strong enough to slowly roll back onto its little beach.
As it crept up, it was terrified of what it would find.

As it arrived, it saw something magical and beautiful.
The beach was full of fresh sand, and so was the ocean.
But this was no ordinary sand. 
The sand was all the colours of the rainbow, and sparkling in the morning sun.
