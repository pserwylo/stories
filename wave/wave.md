# The Wave

The beach was a small beach.
Nobody really visited the beach, except for the wave, and the wind.

Every day, for thousands of years, the same wave crawled up the sand.
And every time it rolled up, it would bring a little extra sand with it from the depths of the ocean, to drop on the beach.

You see, the wave had an important job to do.
There was a trapdoor in the middle of the beach.
But thanks to the hard work of the wave, the trapdoor remained covered in sand.
It was the waves job to make sure the trapdoor stayed covered, so that nothing from the other side could come through.

It was a tough job, because twice a day, the wave would be dragged back into the depths of the ocean, leaving the beach for for half the day.
While it was gone, the wind would roar, trying its best to return the sand back to the ocean.
The wind didn't dislike the wave, or understand the important work the wave was doing to protect the trapdoor.
It just loved blowing around, moving things, and seeing what was underneath.

Lately, the wave was getting tired.
As it rolled up for the first time in the morning, it huffed and it puffed, trying so hard to bring more sand to the beach.
But it was becoming more difficult.
There seemed to be less sand in the ocean, and the wave was not as strong as it used to be.

This time, the wave sighed as it was pulled back from the beach at the end of the day.
It was tired.
Although it was a good days work, there just wasn't enough sand in the ocean for the wave to put on top of the trapdoor.
When night fell, the wind got to work.
It blew and blew, and the sand slowly moved away from the top of the trapdoor, until a tiny corner emerged.

When the wave came back in the morning, there was a strange light shining through the door of the trapdoor, and a quiet "thump, thump" could be heard on the other side.
The wave didn't know what was on the other side, but today was not the day it was going to find out.

The wave immediately got to work, gathering sand from the depths of the ocean and dumping it on the corner of the trapdoor.
By the time the day was complete, the wave was completely exhausted, but it had covered the entire trapdoor.
As it was dragged away, the wave was sure the beach would be safe from whatever was on the other side of the trapdoor.
But how wrong it was.

That night the wind was stronger than it had ever been before.
When it blew across the beach, you could almost hear it get excited about revealing the trapdoor again.
After several hours of huffing and puffing, a corner of the door emerged again.
The light shone through the cracks.
The "thump, thump" came back, but this time louder and rougher.
By the time the morning arrived, more than half the trapdoor was showing and the light was almost as bright as the morning sun.

The wave rolled up, and was so tired it could hardly even bring enough sand.
Each time it brought sand, the "THUMP, THUMP" from the trapdoor shook it off, and more of the trapdoor was revealed.
The wave had lost.
It was unable to continue.
There was no sand left.
It rolled back sadly into the ocean while the "THUMP, THUMP" grew louder and stronger.

With one final "THUMP", the door burst open, and a flash of bright light shot out, blinding the wave and everything else around.
The sound from the trapdoor exploding flattened the water, pushing the wave away.

The wave did not return the next day, or the next.
It took two weeks before the wave was strong enough to slowly roll back onto its little beach.
As it crept up, it was terrified of what it would find.

As it arrived, it saw something magical and beautiful.
The beach was full of fresh sand, and so was the ocean.
But this was no ordinary sand. 
The sand was all the colours of the rainbow, and sparkling in the morning sun.
