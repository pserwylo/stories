# Notes

On a lonely beach (nobody is really there, but maybe sometimes)
Wave creature.
Needs to keep getting further and further up the beach to get more sand.
Tide means half the time the wave isn't there.
Sand is needed to cover up its trap door so its treasure is kept hidden.
Trapdoor is to another realm, and creatues are trying to escape.
It doesn't know what is under, it is afraid of what lies beneath.
But when it finally can't cope and the door opens, out comes rainbow sand.

The wind can be on the side of the trapdoor.
